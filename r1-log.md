The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 24, Saturday, 2018.

## Log

### Day 1: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished pushing all the projects I want to feature on my portfolio onto GitHub. Started configuring the project folder for my portfolio site. Learned how to create and trust SSL certificates using OpenSSL on Windows.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling the momentum building up. By the end of this 100 day stretch, I'm determined to get my first dev job.

### Day 2: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Simple Pig Latin" Codewars kata. Also, migrated from Atom to VS Code and got it set up with ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier and a slew of other custom settings.

**Thoughts**: It's amazing how concise a solution to a JS algorithm can be. I think the time I spent setting up VS Code and all the tools along with it will be worth it when it'll help me conform to established styles and pump out some pro-grade code.

### Day 3: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Wes Bos's CSS Grid course and did some practice layouts with grid. Gearing up to design the layout for my portfolio!

**Thoughts**: Really itching to build my portfolio and get to the next stage of preparing for a job search.

### Day 4: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cranked through all but a few exercises of Wes Bos's CSS Grid course. Also solved the "Valid Parentheses" challenge on Codewars and graduated to 6 kyu!

**Thoughts**: I started worrying about browser support of CSS Grid and considered not using it to design my portfolio layout. After some research on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_and_Progressive_Enhancement), [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid), and [this blog](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/using-feature-queries-in-css/) by Jen Simmons, I'm less worried about and will be going for it. I'm sure there'll be some support headaches to work out, but that's all a part of it!

### Day 5: March 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More CSS Grid exercises today. Toward the end of the CSS Grid course by Wes Bos. Gears are turning for my portfolio design!

**Thoughts**: Really itching to build my portfolio and get to the next stage of preparing for a job search.

### Day 6: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Correct the mistakes of the character recognition software" and the "Remove String Spaces" Codewars katas. My solution for the latter was just like the one voted best practice!

**Thoughts**: Must start portoflio soon! This weekend, can't keep losing time for it.

### Day 7: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Grid course by Wes Bos! Also, completed the "Thinkful - List Drills: Longest word" and "Number of People in the Bus" challenges on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: Nothing that can distract me (not even myself ðŸ˜„) from building my portfolio now. Wanted to start it today but got worn out from the progress of the day as well as from family time.

### Day 8: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent today's coding time configuring and testing the build settings for my portfolio project. Especially took time learning about how minification is done in tbe new version of Webpack especially with its new production mode setting. Spent another good chunk of time getting to know PostCSS and its ecosystem of plugins especially postcss-preset-env. Haven't tried it yet but wondering if I can do custom properties in IE 11 with it. I'll need to leave that experiment for another day however.

**Thoughts**: It's amazing how much time it takes just to setup a project. As much of a tinkerer I am, I need to remember to keep my eyes on the prize and not tinker muself away from the task at hand - my portfolio!

### Day 9: April 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Late post - catching up with this entry after the Easter holiday. Got my build config files setup and tested with some dummy code. Really explored what PostCSS and Webpack's new minification settings were doing for me. With PostCSS, wanted to see how the autoprefixer and postcss-preset-env plugins were processing my CSS Grid and CSS custom properties code especially for supporting IE 11. Learned a great deal about browserslist, the caniuse api, as well as how browsers deal with CSS code it doesn't understand. Also learned about how IE 10+ implemented an old spec of CSS Grid. With Webpack 4's minification, learned a bit about the differences between Babel's minify preset vs. Webpack's optimization settings vs. Babel's minify plugin.

**Thoughts**: Now that all the boring / frustrating config settings are mostly dialed in for the build, I should be able to tear through some actual coding up of my portfolio site. Stoked!
