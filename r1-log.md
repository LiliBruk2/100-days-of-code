## Log

### Day 1: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished pushing all the projects I want to feature on my portfolio onto GitHub.  Started configuring the project folder for my portfolio site. Learned how to create and trust SSL certificates using OpenSSL on Windows.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling the momentum building up.  By the end of this 100 day stretch, I'm determined to get my first dev job.

**Link(s) to work**: [Self-signed SSL gist](https://gist.github.com/klcantrell/518d13d59c4074dbca6310c9b7e6c520)
