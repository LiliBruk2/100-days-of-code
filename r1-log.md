The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 24, Saturday, 2018.

## Log

### Day 1: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished pushing all the projects I want to feature on my portfolio onto GitHub. Started configuring the project folder for my portfolio site. Learned how to create and trust SSL certificates using OpenSSL on Windows.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling the momentum building up. By the end of this 100 day stretch, I'm determined to get my first dev job.

### Day 2: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Simple Pig Latin" Codewars kata. Also, migrated from Atom to VS Code and got it set up with ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier and a slew of other custom settings.

**Thoughts**: It's amazing how concise a solution to a JS algorithm can be. I think the time I spent setting up VS Code and all the tools along with it will be worth it when it'll help me conform to established styles and pump out some pro-grade code.

### Day 3: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Wes Bos's CSS Grid course and did some practice layouts with grid. Gearing up to design the layout for my portfolio!

**Thoughts**: Really itching to build my portfolio and get to the next stage of preparing for a job search.

### Day 4: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cranked through all but a few exercises of Wes Bos's CSS Grid course. Also solved the "Valid Parentheses" challenge on Codewars and graduated to 6 kyu!

**Thoughts**: I started worrying about browser support of CSS Grid and considered not using it to design my portfolio layout. After some research on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_and_Progressive_Enhancement), [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid), and [this blog](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/using-feature-queries-in-css/) by Jen Simmons, I'm less worried about and will be going for it. I'm sure there'll be some support headaches to work out, but that's all a part of it!

### Day 5: March 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More CSS Grid exercises today. Toward the end of the CSS Grid course by Wes Bos. Gears are turning for my portfolio design!

**Thoughts**: Really itching to build my portfolio and get to the next stage of preparing for a job search.

### Day 6: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Correct the mistakes of the character recognition software" and the "Remove String Spaces" Codewars katas. My solution for the latter was just like the one voted best practice!

**Thoughts**: Must start portoflio soon! This weekend, can't keep losing time for it.
