# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Kalalau

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 24, Saturday, 2018.

## Log

### Day 1: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished pushing all the projects I want to feature on my portfolio onto GitHub. Started configuring the project folder for my portfolio site. Learned how to create and trust SSL certificates using OpenSSL on Windows.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling the momentum building up. By the end of this 100 day stretch, I'm determined to get my first dev job.

### Day 2: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Simple Pig Latin" Codewars kata. Also, migrated from Atom to VS Code and got it set up with ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier and a slew of other custom settings.

**Thoughts**: It's amazing how concise a solution to a JS algorithm can be. I think the time I spent setting up VS Code and all the tools along with it will be worth it when it'll help me conform to established styles and pump out some pro-grade code.

### Day 3: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Wes Bos's CSS Grid course and did some practice layouts with grid. Gearing up to design the layout for my portfolio!

**Thoughts**: Really itching to build my portfolio and get to the next stage of preparing for a job search.

### Day 4: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cranked through all but a few exercises of Wes Bos's CSS Grid course. Also solved the "Valid Parentheses" challenge on Codewars and graduated to 6 kyu!

**Thoughts**: I started worrying about browser support of CSS Grid and considered not using it to design my portfolio layout. After some research on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_and_Progressive_Enhancement), [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid), and [this blog](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/using-feature-queries-in-css/) by Jen Simmons, I'm less worried about and will be going for it. I'm sure there'll be some support headaches to work out, but that's all a part of it!

### Day 5: March 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More CSS Grid exercises today. Toward the end of the CSS Grid course by Wes Bos. Gears are turning for my portfolio design!

**Thoughts**: Really itching to build my portfolio and get to the next stage of preparing for a job search.

### Day 6: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Correct the mistakes of the character recognition software" and the "Remove String Spaces" Codewars katas. My solution for the latter was just like the one voted best practice!

**Thoughts**: Must start portoflio soon! This weekend, can't keep losing time for it.

### Day 7: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Grid course by Wes Bos! Also, completed the "Thinkful - List Drills: Longest word" and "Number of People in the Bus" challenges on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: Nothing that can distract me (not even myself ðŸ˜„) from building my portfolio now. Wanted to start it today but got worn out from the progress of the day as well as from family time.

### Day 8: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent today's coding time configuring and testing the build settings for my portfolio project. Especially took time learning about how minification is done in tbe new version of Webpack especially with its new production mode setting. Spent another good chunk of time getting to know PostCSS and its ecosystem of plugins especially postcss-preset-env. Haven't tried it yet but wondering if I can do custom properties in IE 11 with it. I'll need to leave that experiment for another day however.

**Thoughts**: It's amazing how much time it takes just to setup a project. As much of a tinkerer I am, I need to remember to keep my eyes on the prize and not tinker muself away from the task at hand - my portfolio!

### Day 9: April 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Late post - catching up with this entry after the Easter holiday. Got my build config files setup and tested with some dummy code. Really explored what PostCSS and Webpack's new minification settings were doing for me. With PostCSS, wanted to see how the autoprefixer and postcss-preset-env plugins were processing my CSS Grid and CSS custom properties code especially for supporting IE 11. Learned a great deal about browserslist, the caniuse api, as well as how browsers deal with CSS code it doesn't understand. Also learned about how IE 10+ implemented an old spec of CSS Grid. With Webpack 4's minification, learned a bit about the differences between Babel's minify preset vs. Webpack's optimization settings vs. Babel's minify plugin.

**Thoughts**: Now that all the boring / frustrating config settings are mostly dialed in for the build, I should be able to tear through some actual coding up of my portfolio site. Stoked!

### Day 10: April 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent all my coding time today working on my portfolio site. I was able to create a wireframing of my home page as well as flesh it out with some color and images. I am surprised at how much I can do with CSS Grid in IE 11 despite it being the old implementation. So far, I've been able to create a layout in both IE 11 and Firefox Development Edition that I'm pretty happy with and so far they look the same. Thanks to tools like browsersync and postcss, I can see the results of my code right away and make frequent adjustments as I go so that my page looks similar in multiple browsers.

**Thoughts**: Feeling the momentum. Can't wait to get this portfolio to a good place so that I can start thinking about a job search.

### Day 11: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Descending Order" and "Find the next perfect square!" katas on Codewars. Also got more time in wireframing my portfolio specifically the About and Projects sections. May need to search for some design inspiration on how I want these sections to look and how I want transitions from sections to look.

**Thoughts**: It's hard sometimes when you get to staring at a screen trying to simultaneously picture how you want your page to look / respond as well as think through how that could be coded. Important to keep those two mind spaces separate and tackle them one at a time.

### Day 12: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent a ton of time on the portfolio today. I wired up a router that I coded myself with nothing but Vanilla JS. Basic but gets the job done. I also fleshed out styles a little on the landing page as well as wireframed up my Publications section.

**Thoughts**: It's hard when comparing my portfolio to others I've seen to not think that mine perhaps looks dull or clunky. But, it does help drawing inspiration from the designs of others.

### Day 13: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Rot13" kata on Codewars. Worked on the fleshing out the landing page of my portfolio site and included some SVG animations to spice things up.

**Thoughts**: Feels great to be in a groove with my portfolio project. Hope use this weekend to get a lot of work done so I can start thinking about a resume.

### Day 14: April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "How Many Unique Consonants?" kata on Codewars. Tweaked out on the animations that play on the initial load of my portfolio's landing page. I love that open-source tools like KUTE.js are out there to help smooth out browser inconsistencies. Could not get things to play well on IE 11 until I incorporated that library.

**Thoughts**: As with day 13, it feels great to be in a groove with my portfolio project. Hope use this weekend to get a lot of work done so I can start thinking about a resume.

### Day 15: April 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got a lot of good work done on the portfolio today. Actually had a use case for the _pointer-events_ CSS prop because a nested element was blocking what I wanted happening on the parent's _active_ pseudo-class. Also, spent a good deal of setting up a handler of the scroll event that would kick in once the user scrolled down enough. Learned about throttling, _requestAnimationFrame_, and window properties such as _pageYOffset_ and _innerHeight_.

**Thoughts**: Every day brings me that much closer to the job search. Scary and exciting. ðŸ˜®

### Day 16: April 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Directions Reduction" kata on Codewars. Also got more work done on portfolio - added "cross-fade" transitions when changing pages, made landing page more responsive, added some button styles, and made window scroll to top for each page navigation.

**Thoughts**: As in day 15, each day brings me that much closer to the job search. Scary and exciting. ðŸ˜®

### Day 17: April 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Just work on the portfolio today. Added a few breakpoints to ensure intended layout works across a variety of viewports heights and widths. Switched the original "honeycomb" pattern background to a large letter 'K' slowly morphing to a 'C' and then back. It somehow looks less "busy" and more interesting at the same time.

**Thoughts**: Really itching to get this portfolio done!

### Day 18: April 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More portfolio work - navbar is now responsive, refactored my view code into different modules for each view, got a basic content overlay setup for displaying additional info for project items. Code cardio - solved the "Cat and Mouse - 2D Version" kata.

**Thoughts**: Really itching to get this portfolio done!

### Day 19: April 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Summary of portfolio work - Overlay elements now fade in and show additional info about portfolio items when items are clicked. Wired up some basic templating functions with ES2015 template strings that render the content into the overlay element. Had a use case for event delegation for the overlay close button, which gets added dynamically in the template. Code cardio - solved the "Mumbling" kata on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: Really itching to get this portfolio done!

### Day 20: April 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Just more portfolio work - converted my HTML template to use Pug so that I can leverage responsive-loader. Wanting to do a blurred placeholder on first page load then fade in an appropriately sized full image once that loads.

**Thoughts**: I wonder if I should have gone with a framework such as Bootstrap to make this faster, but I am also happy that I building this portfolio from scratch on my own.

### Day 21: April 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Just more portfolio work - profile pic now starts off with a blurred placeholder but loads the appropriately sized image for the viewport. Also added some test project pics so that I could flesh out the structure and styling of my project item cards.

**Thoughts**: Feeling so close but yet so far in terms of my goals to transition into web dev as a career. The list is now finite but still long. When it was still indefinite, it seemed like I had all the time in the world. I know I just need to keep calm and code on.

### Day 22: April 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio - project cards now initially load still frames then fade in gifs when those eventually finish downloading. Gifs also display on overlay when user clicks for additional information.

**Thoughts**: As in day 13, feeling so close but yet so far in terms of my goals to transition into web dev as a career. The list is now finite but still long. When it was still indefinite, it seemed like I had all the time in the world. I know I just need to keep calm and code on.

### Day 23: April 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio - added a row to the splash page that displays icons for each technology I know. Those same icons are displayed in the project cards to show what technologies I used for each project. Signed up for my first real hackatho happening next Friday!

**Thoughts**: As in the past few days, feeling so close but yet so far in terms of my goals to transition into web dev as a career. The list is now finite but still long. When it was still indefinite, it seemed like I had all the time in the world. I know I just need to keep calm and code on.

### Day 24: April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio - got a lot done on my contributions section. Also learned about static methods on E2015 classes - used one to create a utility function for generating icons markup for each of my portfolio item cards.

**Thoughts**: Excited that the portfolio is almost done. Getting that much closer to the job search.

### Day 25: April 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio - more styling on the contributions section. Now, just need to create the contacts section, mess with line heights at various viewports, and add a nav button to link to my blog site.

**Thoughts**: Going to my first real hackathon this weekend!

### Day 26: April 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

* Portfolio - Getting down to the home stretch of the portfolio. Most of the big parts (structure, component behavior, style) are done. Today tweaked things like line-heights and width of p elements to promote readability.
* FOSS - did a lot of research of FOSS projects out there that need contributions. Opened up my first PR to the "First Contributions" project. Nothing more than adding my name to a markdown file but still a great first pr experience..!

**Thoughts**: Going to my first real hackathon this weekend!

### Day 27: April 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio work - I'm pretty much done with 95% of the coding, I think, and now just need to put real content in. Today's work included putting in contacts links in the footer, adding functionality for the overlay pop-up to be close by clicking off, and tweaking line-heights of text at various viewport sizes. I think it'd be a good idea to test this now on a variety of mobile devices as well as my wife's Mac.

**Thoughts**: Stoked to be pretty much done with the portfolio. Really itching to learn React and more Node.js to round out my skillset, too.

### Day 28 - 29: April 20 - 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: My first hackathon! I attended the 2018 AT&T IoT Civic Hack and it was an incredible learning experience. I had the best team mates any first-time hackathon attendee could ask for. They made sure the group picked a project idea that I could contribute to. They also gave me a lot of responsibility and trusted me with it. We all got along great. In the end, we didn't win but we believed in our idea, got a lot done, learned a lot, and felt like it had a chance to make it to the finals.

**Thoughts**: While we were deciding what technologies to use as a group, the idea of using React Native was entertained but ultimately the idea was dropped so that the project wasn't too complex for me to contribute to. Although I appreciated being thought of and included, I didn't like the feeling of holding back the group. I'll have to learn React and React Native sometime soon.

### Day 30 - 31: April 22 - 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio - added favicon as well as a "branding" icon that hangs out at the top left of the page, cleaned up SVG indentation so that minifier could work with it. Completed the "Memory Reallocation" and "Calculating with Functions" katas on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: A friend who's learning to code with me just got a positive response from a job app. Encouraging!

### Day 32 - 35: April 24 - 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Replacing all the dummy content on my portfolio with real content!

**Thoughts**: It's almost like this is harder than coding - coming up with the actual words to describe myself and my projects. Funny how that works!

### Day 36 - 37: April 28 - 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: As in previous entry, replacing all the dummy content on my portfolio with real content. Also, started deploying my project item websites and staging the deploy of my portfolio. Finally, spruced up some of my GitHub project repos by adding a README.md and content to each project.

**Thoughts**: As in the previous entry, it's almost like coming up with content is harder than coding. Funny how that works!

### Day 38: April 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finally deployed my portfolio site! Unfortunately, have to wait 24 hours for my domain name to propogate through the world but feel relieved that the portfolio work is done. Now on to resume work as well as more learning and building!

### Day 39: May 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started learning React! It took me awhile to get started with React because I really liked the idea of understanding the fundamentals. However, after experiencing my first hackathon, I saw the value of knowing a framework because it gives the a team a "common language" as far as project structure and team organization.

**Link(s) to work**: [Portfolio is live!](http://kalalau-cantrell.me)

### Day 40 - 41: May 2 - 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through the React docs ande made my first little app with it - it was the "Thinking In React" filterable product table but I made it without looking at the "code-along" code. It was great seeing how state can be a thing that is organized and flows from a single source. As much as I like figuring things out on my own, it's nice leaning on a tried and true solution that many others subscribe to.

**Thoughts**: Really excited to be at this point where I can learn a framework quickly and start putting it to use right away to make something workable. I know there's a long way to go before I can comfortably say I'm a React developer, but feeling really good about the start.

### Day 42: May 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the official React tutorial of making a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game lets you play against yourself, indicates when a certain player wins, stores the history of moves during the game, and lets you jump back in time to see older versions of the game.

**Thoughts**: May the 4th be with you!

### Day 43: May 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Knocked out the "Breadcrumb Generator" kata on Codewars and ranked up to 5kyu! Heckin heck yeah! Also, set up a personal Trello board to keep track of my to dos for studying, projects, and goals.

### Day 44: May 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Going over the React fundamentals again with Kent C. Dodd's and his course on egghead.io. Although he covers the basics that you can find on the official React docs, actually hearing it and seeing it play out over video is helping it stick. Highly recommend!

### Day 45: May 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with Kent C. Dodd's course. Check out the repository I'm committing to to see details on my progress through the course.

**Link(s) to work**: [Learn React with Kent C. Dodds](https://github.com/klcantrell/learn-react-with-kentcdodds)

### Day 46: May 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Kent C. Dodd's course and now going over the fundamentals one more time with a quick run through Joe Maddalone's _Start Learning React_ course on egghead.io. Check out the repository I'm committing to to see details on my progress through the course.

**Link(s) to work**: [Learn React with Joe Maddalone](https://github.com/klcantrell/learn-react-with-joemaddalone)

### Day 47: May 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed lots of React basics - stateful vs. stateless components, props and state, the synthetic event system, lifecycle methods, how to reference the actual DOM if need be, prop validation..., WHEW! I think I'm starting to retain the info though and glad I spent a lot of time getting vanilla JS basics down pat before diving into framework land.

### Day 48 - 50: May 10 - 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed React basics - using map to programmatically create components, .Children utilities, the .cloneElement utility, and how to parameterize components to make them reusable.

**Link(s) to work**: [Learn React with Joe Maddalone](https://github.com/klcantrell/learn-react-with-joemaddalone)

### Day 51 - 52: May 13 - 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

* Giving the basics of React one more review with Colt Steele and friends - how to create and compose multiple React components and scaffold an app with create-react-app.
* Also, made updates to the portfolio especially regarding gifs. Making sure gifs don't play unless hovered over or touchstarted - trying to cut down on the jank it causes otherwise. Also, fixed some things that weren't showing up right in IE 11: text overflowing in the contributions section, feDropShadow causing an SVG not to appear, and headers in the overflow overlay being covered by the close button.
* Made some updates to the HydraBase project so that layout would look right in a mobile sized viewport.

**Link(s) to work**: [K-Warbler](https://github.com/klcantrell/k-warbler)

### Day 53: May 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing props, propTypes, and default props by making components for a simple recipe app UI. Quite fun making UIs with components!

### Day 54 - 55: May 16 - 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing state, component architecture (where state lives, how state flows, stateless components, etc.), how to attach events to components, and how to control form elements with React.

### Day 56 - 60: May 18 - 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Have not been posting a lot lately but I have been coding a lot. Made a couple of small React apps such as a todo list, a recipe app, a memory game, and a guessing game to get practice with all the concepts I've learned thus far. Next, going to be making a small full stack React/Express/MongoDB app to tie things together even more. Then hope to get cracking on some bigger projects.

### Day 61 - 67: May 23 - 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Not a ton of posting, but a ton of coding.

* Started learning Redux.
* Made a contribution to a local open source project and got it merged!
* Started a full-stack project with a friend - he's working on the back-end and I on the front-end. Stack so far is React + Redux, GoLang, and variety of coverage frameworks including Jest, Code Climate, and Travis CI.

### Day 68 - 71: May 30 - June 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Coded for an hour or more everyday - catching up with posts:

* Practice wiring React-Redux inside of a (big surprise) basic todo app
* Practice integrating React, Redux, Redux Thunk, React Router, and a basic Node setup by creating a (you guessed it) basic todo app
* Had a merge request go through for a form widget feature I created for a React app I'm working on with a friend
