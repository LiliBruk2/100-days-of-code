The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 24, Saturday, 2018.

## Log

### Day 1: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished pushing all the projects I want to feature on my portfolio onto GitHub. Started configuring the project folder for my portfolio site. Learned how to create and trust SSL certificates using OpenSSL on Windows.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling the momentum building up. By the end of this 100 day stretch, I'm determined to get my first dev job.

### Day 2: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Simple Pig Latin" Codewars kata. Also, migrated from Atom to VS Code and got it set up with ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier and a slew of other custom settings.

**Thoughts**: It's amazing how concise a solution to a JS algorithm can be. I think the time I spent setting up VS Code and all the tools along with it will be worth it when it'll help me conform to established styles and pump out some pro-grade code.

### Day 3: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Wes Bos's CSS Grid course and did some practice layouts with grid. Gearing up to design the layout for my portfolio!

**Thoughts**: Really itching to build my portfolio and get to the next stage of preparing for a job search.
