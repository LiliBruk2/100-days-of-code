# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Kalalau

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 24, Saturday, 2018.

## Log

### Day 1: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished pushing all the projects I want to feature on my portfolio onto GitHub. Started configuring the project folder for my portfolio site. Learned how to create and trust SSL certificates using OpenSSL on Windows.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling the momentum building up. By the end of this 100 day stretch, I'm determined to get my first dev job.

### Day 2: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Simple Pig Latin" Codewars kata. Also, migrated from Atom to VS Code and got it set up with ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier and a slew of other custom settings.

**Thoughts**: It's amazing how concise a solution to a JS algorithm can be. I think the time I spent setting up VS Code and all the tools along with it will be worth it when it'll help me conform to established styles and pump out some pro-grade code.

### Day 3: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Wes Bos's CSS Grid course and did some practice layouts with grid. Gearing up to design the layout for my portfolio!

**Thoughts**: Really itching to build my portfolio and get to the next stage of preparing for a job search.

### Day 4: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cranked through all but a few exercises of Wes Bos's CSS Grid course. Also solved the "Valid Parentheses" challenge on Codewars and graduated to 6 kyu!

**Thoughts**: I started worrying about browser support of CSS Grid and considered not using it to design my portfolio layout. After some research on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_and_Progressive_Enhancement), [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid), and [this blog](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/using-feature-queries-in-css/) by Jen Simmons, I'm less worried about and will be going for it. I'm sure there'll be some support headaches to work out, but that's all a part of it!

### Day 5: March 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More CSS Grid exercises today. Toward the end of the CSS Grid course by Wes Bos. Gears are turning for my portfolio design!

**Thoughts**: Really itching to build my portfolio and get to the next stage of preparing for a job search.

### Day 6: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Correct the mistakes of the character recognition software" and the "Remove String Spaces" Codewars katas. My solution for the latter was just like the one voted best practice!

**Thoughts**: Must start portoflio soon! This weekend, can't keep losing time for it.

### Day 7: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Grid course by Wes Bos! Also, completed the "Thinkful - List Drills: Longest word" and "Number of People in the Bus" challenges on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: Nothing that can distract me (not even myself ðŸ˜„) from building my portfolio now. Wanted to start it today but got worn out from the progress of the day as well as from family time.

### Day 8: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent today's coding time configuring and testing the build settings for my portfolio project. Especially took time learning about how minification is done in tbe new version of Webpack especially with its new production mode setting. Spent another good chunk of time getting to know PostCSS and its ecosystem of plugins especially postcss-preset-env. Haven't tried it yet but wondering if I can do custom properties in IE 11 with it. I'll need to leave that experiment for another day however.

**Thoughts**: It's amazing how much time it takes just to setup a project. As much of a tinkerer I am, I need to remember to keep my eyes on the prize and not tinker muself away from the task at hand - my portfolio!

### Day 9: April 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Late post - catching up with this entry after the Easter holiday. Got my build config files setup and tested with some dummy code. Really explored what PostCSS and Webpack's new minification settings were doing for me. With PostCSS, wanted to see how the autoprefixer and postcss-preset-env plugins were processing my CSS Grid and CSS custom properties code especially for supporting IE 11. Learned a great deal about browserslist, the caniuse api, as well as how browsers deal with CSS code it doesn't understand. Also learned about how IE 10+ implemented an old spec of CSS Grid. With Webpack 4's minification, learned a bit about the differences between Babel's minify preset vs. Webpack's optimization settings vs. Babel's minify plugin.

**Thoughts**: Now that all the boring / frustrating config settings are mostly dialed in for the build, I should be able to tear through some actual coding up of my portfolio site. Stoked!

### Day 10: April 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent all my coding time today working on my portfolio site. I was able to create a wireframing of my home page as well as flesh it out with some color and images. I am surprised at how much I can do with CSS Grid in IE 11 despite it being the old implementation. So far, I've been able to create a layout in both IE 11 and Firefox Development Edition that I'm pretty happy with and so far they look the same. Thanks to tools like browsersync and postcss, I can see the results of my code right away and make frequent adjustments as I go so that my page looks similar in multiple browsers.

**Thoughts**: Feeling the momentum. Can't wait to get this portfolio to a good place so that I can start thinking about a job search.

### Day 11: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Descending Order" and "Find the next perfect square!" katas on Codewars. Also got more time in wireframing my portfolio specifically the About and Projects sections. May need to search for some design inspiration on how I want these sections to look and how I want transitions from sections to look.

**Thoughts**: It's hard sometimes when you get to staring at a screen trying to simultaneously picture how you want your page to look / respond as well as think through how that could be coded. Important to keep those two mind spaces separate and tackle them one at a time.

### Day 12: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent a ton of time on the portfolio today. I wired up a router that I coded myself with nothing but Vanilla JS. Basic but gets the job done. I also fleshed out styles a little on the landing page as well as wireframed up my Publications section.

**Thoughts**: It's hard when comparing my portfolio to others I've seen to not think that mine perhaps looks dull or clunky. But, it does help drawing inspiration from the designs of others.

### Day 13: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Rot13" kata on Codewars. Worked on the fleshing out the landing page of my portfolio site and included some SVG animations to spice things up.

**Thoughts**: Feels great to be in a groove with my portfolio project. Hope use this weekend to get a lot of work done so I can start thinking about a resume.

### Day 14: April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "How Many Unique Consonants?" kata on Codewars. Tweaked out on the animations that play on the initial load of my portfolio's landing page. I love that open-source tools like KUTE.js are out there to help smooth out browser inconsistencies. Could not get things to play well on IE 11 until I incorporated that library.

**Thoughts**: As with day 13, it feels great to be in a groove with my portfolio project. Hope use this weekend to get a lot of work done so I can start thinking about a resume.

### Day 15: April 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got a lot of good work done on the portfolio today. Actually had a use case for the _pointer-events_ CSS prop because a nested element was blocking what I wanted happening on the parent's _active_ pseudo-class. Also, spent a good deal of setting up a handler of the scroll event that would kick in once the user scrolled down enough. Learned about throttling, _requestAnimationFrame_, and window properties such as _pageYOffset_ and _innerHeight_.

**Thoughts**: Every day brings me that much closer to the job search. Scary and exciting. ðŸ˜®

### Day 16: April 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Directions Reduction" kata on Codewars. Also got more work done on portfolio - added "cross-fade" transitions when changing pages, made landing page more responsive, added some button styles, and made window scroll to top for each page navigation.

**Thoughts**: As in day 15, each day brings me that much closer to the job search. Scary and exciting. ðŸ˜®

### Day 17: April 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Just work on the portfolio today. Added a few breakpoints to ensure intended layout works across a variety of viewports heights and widths. Switched the original "honeycomb" pattern background to a large letter 'K' slowly morphing to a 'C' and then back. It somehow looks less "busy" and more interesting at the same time.

**Thoughts**: Really itching to get this portfolio done!

### Day 18: April 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More portfolio work - navbar is now responsive, refactored my view code into different modules for each view, got a basic content overlay setup for displaying additional info for project items. Code cardio - solved the "Cat and Mouse - 2D Version" kata.

**Thoughts**: Really itching to get this portfolio done!

### Day 19: April 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Summary of portfolio work - Overlay elements now fade in and show additional info about portfolio items when items are clicked. Wired up some basic templating functions with ES2015 template strings that render the content into the overlay element. Had a use case for event delegation for the overlay close button, which gets added dynamically in the template. Code cardio - solved the "Mumbling" kata on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: Really itching to get this portfolio done!

### Day 20: April 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Just more portfolio work - converted my HTML template to use Pug so that I can leverage responsive-loader. Wanting to do a blurred placeholder on first page load then fade in an appropriately sized full image once that loads.

**Thoughts**: I wonder if I should have gone with a framework such as Bootstrap to make this faster, but I am also happy that I building this portfolio from scratch on my own.

### Day 21: April 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Just more portfolio work - profile pic now starts off with a blurred placeholder but loads the appropriately sized image for the viewport. Also added some test project pics so that I could flesh out the structure and styling of my project item cards.

**Thoughts**: Feeling so close but yet so far in terms of my goals to transition into web dev as a career. The list is now finite but still long. When it was still indefinite, it seemed like I had all the time in the world. I know I just need to keep calm and code on.
